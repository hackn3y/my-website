# Favicon Instructions

Your site is now configured to use favicons! Here's how to create them:

## Quick Method (Recommended)

1. **Use an online favicon generator:**
   - Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/ or https://realfavicongenerator.net/
   - Upload your logo or profile image (ideally a square image, at least 512x512px)
   - Download the generated favicon package

2. **Extract the files to your website root:**
   - `favicon-16x16.png` (16x16 pixels)
   - `favicon-32x32.png` (32x32 pixels)
   - `apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180 pixels)

3. **Place them in the root directory** (same folder as index.html)

## Manual Method

If you want to create them manually:

1. **Create a square logo** (512x512px or larger)
   - Use simple, bold designs that work at small sizes
   - Your initials "RH" in orange would work great
   - Or use a simplified version of your profile photo

2. **Resize to needed dimensions:**
   - 32x32 pixels → save as `favicon-32x32.png`
   - 16x16 pixels → save as `favicon-16x16.png`
   - 180x180 pixels → save as `apple-touch-icon.png`

3. **Tools you can use:**
   - Photoshop, GIMP (free)
   - Canva (online, free)
   - Paint.NET (Windows, free)

## Design Suggestions

For your brand, consider:
- Orange background (#ff6b35) with white "RH" initials
- Your profile photo cropped to a circle with orange border
- A simple gear or code symbol in orange
- A hexagon or technical shape with your initials

## Testing

After adding the favicons:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Visit your site
3. Check the browser tab - you should see your icon!
4. Test on mobile by adding to home screen

## Note

The site will work fine without favicons - the browser will just show a default icon. But having a favicon makes your site look more professional!
